eMac CRT rasppi conversion

The goal of this project is to utilized the crt monitor in a early 2000s apple eMac. I have found a few incomplete guides online and plan to expand on them to better document the process. For now I am using the Wiki feature on Github to document everything. See here: https://github.com/mbaum0193/emac-pi/wiki
